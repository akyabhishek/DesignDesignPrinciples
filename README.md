# Design Principles

A collection of fundamental software design principles with practical Java implementations.

## üìã Principles Covered

### SOLID Principles

- **[Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)](./SOLID-principles/01-single-responsibility-principle.java)** - A class should have only one reason to change
- **[Open/Closed Principle (OCP)](./SOLID-principles/02-open-closed-principle.java)** - Software entities should be open for extension, closed for modification
- **[Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)](./SOLID-principles/03-liskov-substitution-principle.java)** - Objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes
- **[Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)](./SOLID-principles/04-interface-segregation-principle.java)** - Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use
- **[Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](./SOLID-principles/05-dependency-inversion-principle.java)** - Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Other Essential Principles

- **[DRY Principle](./DRY-principle/dry-principle.java)** - Don't Repeat Yourself
- **[KISS Principle](./KiSS-principle/kiss-principle.java)** - Keep It Simple, Stupid
- **[YAGNI Principle](./YAGNI-principle/yagni-principle.java)** - You Aren't Gonna Need It

## üöÄ Getting Started

Each principle is demonstrated with practical Java examples. Click on any principle above to view its implementation and understand how to apply it in your code.

## üìù Note

This repository focuses on code examples rather than theory. Each file contains well-commented implementations that demonstrate the principle in action.
